# 🚀 My First JavaScript Projects

Hey there! 👋  
This repo contains one of my **first JavaScript projects**.  
I'm just getting started on my JavaScript journey and exploring the basics through hands-on mini-projects.
- 🔭 DEMO of the site: [COUNTER](https://keyelty-dev.github.io/counter/)

## 🎯 My Goals

- Practice core JavaScript concepts (like DOM, events, variables, and functions)
- Build small, functional apps to understand things better
- Slowly build up a portfolio as I grow as a front-end developer

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 🚧 Current Status

This is a learning project — not perfect, but a step forward!  
As I learn more, I’ll improve and build more advanced projects along the way.

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

If you’re also learning JavaScript or just passing by, feel free to share feedback or connect!  
I’d love to hear your thoughts or collab in the future. 😊
